During development, let's use a consistent set of packages.
1. Create a venv via `python -m venv venv`
2. Activate the venv via `source venv/bin/activate` on Mac/Linux and `.\venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows. 
   *Don't track the venv by adding it to the `.gitignore` file (via the following line: `venv`)*
3. Whenever you install a new package, remember to create a corresponding requirements file via `pip freeze > requirements.txt`
4. Install from the requirements file using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
